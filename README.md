# Twitter-Sentimental-Analysis

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a hotbed of research in data science these days and one of the most common applications of NLP is sentiment analysis. From opinion polls to creating entire marketing strategies, this domain has completely reshaped the way businesses work, which is why this is an area every data scientist must be familiar with.Thousands of text documents can be processed for sentiment (and other features including named entities, topics, themes, etc.) in seconds, compared to the hours it would take a team of people to manually complete the same task.We will do so by following a sequence of steps needed to solve a general sentiment analysis problem. We will start with preprocessing and cleaning of the raw text of the tweets. Then we will explore the cleaned text and try to get some intuition about the context of the tweets. After that, we will extract numerical features from the data and finally use these feature sets to train models and identify the sentiments of the tweets.

#Tweets pre-processing and cleaning

You are searching for a document in this office space. In which scenario are you more likely to find the document easily? Of course, in the less cluttered one because each item is kept in its proper place. The data cleaning exercise is quite similar. If the data is arranged in a structured format then it becomes easier to find the right information.

The preprocessing of the text data is an essential step as it makes the raw text ready for mining, i.e., it becomes easier to extract information from the text and apply machine learning algorithms to it. If we skip this step then there is a higher chance that you are working with noisy and inconsistent data. The objective of this step is to clean noise those are less relevant to find the sentiment of tweets such as punctuation, special characters, numbers, and terms which don’t carry much weightage in context to the text.

In one of the later stages, we will be extracting numeric features from our Twitter text data. This feature space is created using all the unique words present in the entire data. So, if we preprocess our data well, then we would be able to get a better quality feature space.

Let’s first read our data and load the necessary libraries.
